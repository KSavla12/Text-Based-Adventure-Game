            Armed with your trusty lantern, you cautiously descend into the cellar, its dark depths illuminated 
            by the light. A narrow stone corridor stretches before you, leading you deeper underground. You 
            follow the passageway for what feels like an eternity until you finally arrive in a sizable room. In 
            the center lies a captivating sightâ€”a heap of gleaming gold coins. Above, a crevice reveals itself, 
            seemingly a pathway back to the surface resembling a wishing well.

            However, your attention is swiftly diverted as you catch the sound of heavy footsteps resonating 
            across the room. As the source of the sound steps into the light, a monstrous troll emerges, wielding 
            a massive wooden club.
